### Theatre API: A very fast PoC

This API was very quickly written in order to do the following:

1. Have an model to serve as a basic REST
2. Have the controller take care of four routes for CRUD
3. Use a library to autogenerate an OpenAPI Spec doc
4. Generate json schema and upload it to Tyk cloud.
